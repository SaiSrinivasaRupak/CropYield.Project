This project amalgamates machine learning prowess with web development to create a comprehensive solution for crop yield prediction. The core of the project lies in employing Decision Tree Regression, a robust machine learning algorithm, to forecast crop yields based on critical agronomic factors: temperature, soil moisture, humidity, cultivation area, and crop type. By harnessing Decision Tree Regression's capability to capture intricate relationships within data, the model can offer precise predictions tailored to specific agricultural scenarios.

In addition to the machine learning model, the project integrates Flask, a lightweight web framework in Python, to develop a user-friendly website. Leveraging Flask's simplicity and flexibility, a web interface is crafted, enabling users to input relevant parameters such as temperature, soil moisture, humidity, area, and select the crop type. Upon submission, the website seamlessly communicates with the machine learning model, which then processes the inputs and generates a prediction for the crop yield.
